# Contributing to Tinkerly.io

Thank you for considering contributing to Tinkerly.io! As an open source project from the VT Infinite ecosystem (including Okestra NLP CRM, ReadMyMRI, KnightVizion, Perswade Watson, and VTI Stablecoin), we value community input to build a better platform for collaborative software creation.

## Code of Conduct

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. By contributing, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct (adapted from the Contributor Covenant). Report unacceptable behavior to matthew@vt-infinite.com.

## How to Contribute

1. **Issues**:
   - Search existing issues before creating a new one.
   - Use clear titles and descriptions; include screenshots/logs for bugs.
   - Label appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted).

2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - Fork the repo and create a branch (e.g., `feature/ai-analysis-improvements`).
   - Follow our style: Use ESLint/Prettier (run `npm run lint`).
   - Commit messages: Conventional Commits (e.g., "feat: add AI royalty calculator").
   - Test locally: Ensure `npm test` passes; cover new features.
   - PR Template: Describe changes, link issues, confirm tests pass.
   - We aim for "zero defects"—include unit tests for AI/ML components.

3. **Development Setup**:
   - Follow README.md installation.
   - Use feature branches; rebase on main before PR.
   - For AI features: Leverage our knowledge bank—test with sample data from /tests/.

4. **Areas for Contribution**:
   - AI Enhancements: Improve project analysis (current pricing is aligned to my speed algorithmically - nobody should ever try and sustain that!)
   - UI/UX: Refine dashboard with accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA, as in VTI).
   - Integrations: Add Walrus blob storage for royalties.
   - Docs: Expand README or add tutorials.
   - Bug Fixes: Prioritize security/privacy (e.g., no sensitives in code).

## Review Process

- PRs reviewed within 48 hours.
- We may request changes—collaborate iteratively.
- Merged PRs credit you in changelogs.
